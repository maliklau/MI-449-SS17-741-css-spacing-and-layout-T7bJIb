        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Currently I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science from Michigan State University's College of Engineering. When I'm not coding or attending classes, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. Growing up in Southeast Michigan near Lake St. Clair naturally lead me to develop a love for water sports such as swimming, wakeboarding, and boating. I really enjoy listening to a myriad of music genres, playing the piano, and photography. Enjoy your visit to my site!
